# Control sonos speakers from dotnet

Always wanted to control sonos speakers right from your dotnet application? I've created this library for you to do just that.

**Warning** This library is far from complete at the moment, it's just an experiment for now.

## Developer

A lot in this library is generated by the [sonos generator](https://github.com/svrooij/sonos-api-docs/tree/main/generator/sonos-docs). You can use the following script to regenerate the pre-generated models.

```bash
# Install the generator (once)
npm install -g @svrooij/sonos-docs

# Combine the different sources to one simple file (once, unless service definition changed)
sonos-docs combine

# Generate library (windows)
sonos-docs generate .\src\sonos-net-template\ .\src\

# Generate library (linux/mac)
sonos-docs generate ./src/sonos-net-template/ ./src/
```
